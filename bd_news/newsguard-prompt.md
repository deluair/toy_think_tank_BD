# NewsGuard

## Project Overview

NewsGuard is a comprehensive Python-based simulation framework that models the complex digital news ecosystem of Bangladesh, with particular focus on the challenges faced by major news outlets like Prothom Alo. This project creates a realistic synthetic environment to study, analyze, and develop solutions for critical issues including misinformation spread, cross-border information warfare, reader trust dynamics, and the economic sustainability of digital journalism in the Global South.

## Problem Statement

Bangladesh's digital news landscape faces unprecedented challenges that threaten both democratic discourse and media sustainability:

1. **Misinformation Epidemic**: 72 Indian media outlets spread at least 137 false reports on 32 topics about Bangladesh in 2024, averaging one false report every 2.5 days
2. **Cross-Border Information Warfare**: Following the 2024 revolutionary movement in Bangladesh, a surge of misinformation spread across social media, particularly from ultra-right-wing influencers in India
3. **AI-Generated Deepfakes**: Pro-government news outlets and influencers in Bangladesh are promoting disinformation by using cheap Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to produce deep fake videos
4. **Trust Erosion**: When falsehoods are presented as facts, and when information is spread under false pretences, genuine dialogue and debate become increasingly difficult
5. **Economic Pressures**: Traditional revenue models are collapsing while digital transformation requires significant investment

## Core Objectives

1. **Simulate the Bangladesh Digital News Ecosystem**: Create a multi-agent system representing news outlets, social media platforms, readers, advertisers, fact-checkers, and malicious actors
2. **Model Misinformation Dynamics**: Track how false narratives spread across platforms and communities
3. **Analyze Cross-Platform Propagation**: Study how stories move between traditional media, social media, and messaging apps
4. **Evaluate Intervention Strategies**: Test various approaches to combat misinformation while maintaining press freedom
5. **Optimize Revenue Models**: Simulate different business models for sustainable digital journalism
