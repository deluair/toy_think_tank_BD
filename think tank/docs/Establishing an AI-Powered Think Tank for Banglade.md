# Establishing an AI-Powered Think Tank for Bangladesh: A Revolutionary Approach to Policy Research

This comprehensive analysis presents a blueprint for creating Bangladesh's first artificial intelligence-powered policy research institute, leveraging 100 specialized AI agents to address the nation's most pressing development challenges. The proposed model represents a paradigm shift from traditional think tank operations, combining minimal human oversight with advanced AI capabilities to deliver unprecedented research capacity and policy insights for Bangladesh's critical development needs [^1][^2][^3]. This revolutionary approach addresses Bangladesh's complex policy landscape while positioning the country as a regional leader in AI-driven governance and policy innovation [^15][^31][^38].

## Current Think Tank Landscape in Bangladesh

Bangladesh's existing think tank ecosystem comprises several established institutions that have built credibility over decades of policy research and analysis. The Centre for Policy Dialogue, established in 1993, serves as the country's premier think tank and has successfully created a neutral space where government and opposition parties engage in informed policy discussions [^6]. Other significant institutions include the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies, ranked 36th among global defense and national security think tanks, and the Policy Research Institute, which focuses on economic policy analysis and has contributed to major planning documents including the Sixth Five Year Plan [^2][^5][^8].

The traditional think tank model in Bangladesh faces several limitations that the proposed AI-powered approach can address effectively. Current institutions rely heavily on human researchers, limiting their capacity to process vast amounts of data and respond rapidly to emerging policy challenges [^1][^4]. The fragmented nature of policy research across multiple institutions often results in duplicated efforts and inconsistent analytical frameworks [^7]. Additionally, resource constraints limit the scope and frequency of research outputs, particularly for comprehensive cross-sectoral analysis that requires significant human resources [^33].

The emergence of specialized research centers, such as the Bangladesh Centre for Terrorism Research within the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies, demonstrates the growing need for focused expertise in specific policy domains [^3]. However, these specialized units operate in isolation, lacking the integrated analytical capabilities that could provide holistic policy recommendations across interconnected challenges. The proposed AI-powered model addresses these limitations by enabling simultaneous analysis across multiple domains while maintaining specialized expertise in each area [^23][^27][^29].

## Bangladesh's Critical Policy Priorities

Bangladesh faces a complex array of interrelated policy challenges that require sophisticated analytical capabilities and rapid response mechanisms. Youth employment emerges as the highest priority concern, with unemployment rates reaching 16.8 percent among young people and 30.9 percent of youth classified as not in education, employment, or training [^33][^36]. The skills gap between educational outcomes and labor market demands particularly affects tertiary-educated youth, where unemployment rates reached 43 percent in 2019, highlighting fundamental misalignments in the education-employment ecosystem [^33].

Climate adaptation represents another critical priority, with Bangladesh facing severe vulnerabilities including sea-level rise, cyclone intensification, and agricultural salinization that threaten millions of livelihoods [^10][^34][^37]. The National Adaptation Plan requires \$230 billion in investment over 27 years, with 72.5 percent needed by 2040, demonstrating the scale of analytical and planning capabilities required to optimize resource allocation and implementation strategies [^37]. Current climate adaptation efforts, while extensive, lack the real-time analytical capacity to integrate rapidly changing climate data with socioeconomic impacts and policy responses [^34].

Economic diversification beyond the ready-made garments sector remains essential for sustainable growth, with the World Bank identifying export diversification and financial sector reforms as critical development priorities [^13][^14]. The interim government's digital transformation strategy aims to achieve a "full digital economy and smart governance" by 2030, requiring coordinated analysis across technology, policy, and implementation frameworks [^31][^32]. These challenges demand analytical capabilities that can process multiple data streams simultaneously and provide integrated policy recommendations across sectors [^9][^11][^12].
